This folder contains all the prediction-related files 
for PSP's perihelion encounter P7.

The main repostitory is through Dropbox, but this
GitHub repository will be synced with the Dropbox 
folder every hour. 

If you're planning to submit your predictions 
via git, please let Pete or Sam know so that they
can adjust the timing of the final syncing 
and creating of the final ensembles and 
visualisations.
